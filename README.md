# The Little Robot created by Mycosis Inc
The Little Robot was created as the 4th year Capstone project of 6 Carleton students through their shared passion of video games. 

The Little Robot is a linear 3D platforming and melee combat game where you play as a small robot trapped in an isolated testing facility, unaware of the world beyond its walls. As you explore and master powerful abilities, mysterious figures lurk in the shadows, watching your every move. Navigate the facility’s depths, uncover its secrets, and fight for survival against a relentless enemy robot—all while dealing with the encroaching threat of an otherworldly fungal rot that's been running rampant throughout the facility.
